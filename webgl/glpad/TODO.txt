GUI:
o Extract glClearColor from HTML
o Checkbox for enable/disable automatic ModelViewMatrix rotation
o Trackball rotation using mouse
o Zoom and pan using mouse

Infrastructure:
o Texture support
o Call gl.verifyProgram() to be able to detect more errors
o Clean up state between each frame to avoid leaking state
o Look more closely at per-frame VBO operations. What is actually necessary?

Example shaders:
o Texture
o Light
o Lit texture

Example objects:
o Sphere
o Torus
o Teapot
