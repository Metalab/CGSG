/*

load/trace all imgs from directory via opencv  (one 3200x3200 img per scene)
put each in separate vertex/normal/color array


moveable & resizeable FFT grid!!!
switch vertexarrays on keypress

ESC 					= quit
arrow left		= load next image (leaks a little memory)
arrow right		= load prev image (leaks a little memory)
arrow up			= adjust fft grid alignment (see console output "specdivisor: 1, x:64 y:64")
arrow down		= adjust fft grid alignment (see console output "specdivisor: 1, x:64 y:64")
ctrl + up			= increase fft grid size (*2)    max fft grid size = 64x64!!!
ctrl + down		= decrease fft grid size (/2)		 max fft grid size = 64x64!!!
shift + up		= increase fft spectrum vars per polygon		(see console: polysearchdistance: 500.000000)
shift + down	= decrease fft spectrum vars per polygon		(see console: polysearchdistance: 500.000000)

shift+ctrl+up	= increase volume needed for cam change by 0.01  (see console: CAM_SWITCH_VOLUME: 0.039)
shift+ctrl+down	= decrease volume needed for cam change by 0.01

1,2,3,4				= select cam x
x							= switch to camera "drive" mode
c							= switch to camera "drag" mode
h							= switch to camera "rotate" mode

u							= mute / halt animation
y							= toggle auto cam switch mode on spectrum (bass hits certain volume)
5							= toggle draw Roofs
q							= toggle draw polygons
a							= toggle draw fft grid
shift + a			= toggle draw fft grid to polygon center lines (slow but also neat)
i							= toggle inertia navigation for camera movement(default off! )

-------
walkthrough:
start it
press "1"
	adjust your cam with x, c, h & mouse
press "2"
	adjust cam 2 with x, c, h & mouse
... etc for cam 3 & 4

toggle stuff u want to draw (fft grid/ polygons)


//(cam movement via midiMsg)



data structure:
