GUI:
o Checkbox for enable/disable automatic ModelViewMatrix rotation
o Trackball rotation using mouse
o Zoom and pan using mouse

Infrastructure:
o Improved Texture support (texture format, multitexturing)
o Call gl.verifyProgram() to be able to detect more errors
o Clean up state between each frame to avoid leaking state
o Look more closely at per-frame VBO operations. What is actually necessary?
o Auto-generate shader and geometry index

Example shaders:
o Light
o Lit texture

Example objects:
o Torus
o Teapot
