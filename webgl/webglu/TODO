NEED
-Handle multi-pass shaders
-Automatic handling of framebuffers as needed - mostly done
-Integrate object picking
-Lighting system
-'Attachment' system for shader programs overrideable from objects
    -Textures
    -Cubemaps
    -Defaults for each
-Object specific override hooks for pretty much everything

WANT
-Further optimization for speed
-Robust library of shaders
-Lots of examples
-Spline interpolation
-Inverse kinematics
-Attachment system checks compatability with currently associated shader 
 program
        -Warns if issues are found e.g. attaching a texture, but there's no
         sampler in the shader.
        -Warning doesn't block and can be overridden with additional param
